# Rock Paper Scissors

This is a repository for my take on the classic game Rock, Paper, Scissors. The timeline of this assignment spanned four days and served as a learning opportunity to deepen my understanding of JavaScript objects and DOM manipulation.

## Lessons Learned

I wanted to challenge myself to leverage JavaScript objects for this project. As this is my first experience working with objects in JavaScript, there were many valuable takeaways, including:

- Creating and using JavaScript objects to encapsulate logic and state.
- Understanding the __this__ keyword in the context of object methods.
- Nesting functions within objects and calling them dynamically.
- Using the data-* attribute in HTML and accessing it in JavaScript.
- Making a responsive site that gradually changes with viewport width.
- Applying CSS properties like object-fit and object-position for image handling.
- Utilizing the __details__ and __summary__ HTML tags for collapsible instructions.
